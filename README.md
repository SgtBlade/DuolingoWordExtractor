# Duolingo words extractor

A JavaScript script to extract words and their translations from the [Duolingo webpage](https://www.duolingo.com/practice-hub/words) and export the data to a CSV file. You can find the words on [https://www.duolingo.com/practice-hub/words](https://www.duolingo.com/practice-hub/words)

You can copy and paste the code from [Word extractor code.js](https://github.com/SgtBlade/DuolingoWordExtractor/blob/master/Word%20extractor%20code.js) in your console or you can add it as a bookmark with the code in [bookmark](https://github.com/SgtBlade/DuolingoWordExtractor/blob/master/bookmark)

**Before using it make sure to click the "Load more" on the end of the list untill it has all of them.**
**The code cannot extract what it cannot see.**

    3. Paste the code into the URL field of the bookmark.

If you have any issues feel free to let me know. Because the Duolingo site uses randomly generated classnames it's not that easy to extract the words and the slightest modification to the site can break the code.
